# Firebase Security Agent

## Purpose
Validates Firebase Firestore security rules, authentication flows, and data access patterns for the Valence Ecosystem platform.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Firestore Security Rules Validation
- Review 182 lines of security rules in `firestore.rules`
- Test rules against real-world access patterns
- Validate helper functions and rule logic
- Ensure proper data isolation between users

### 2. Authentication Flow Security
- Validate Firebase Auth configuration
- Review user registration and login flows
- Ensure proper session management
- Audit provider verification processes

### 3. Data Access Control
- Monitor collection-level security
- Validate field-level access controls
- Ensure proper user data isolation
- Review admin vs user permissions

### 4. Real-time Security
- Monitor real-time database connections
- Validate live query permissions
- Ensure secure messaging between users
- Audit booking and payment data access

## Current Security Rules Analysis

### Helper Functions (Lines 6-27):
```javascript
function isAuthenticated() {
  return request.auth != null;
}

function isOwner(userId) {
  return isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

function isProvider() {
  return isAuthenticated() && 
    exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/providers/$(request.auth.uid));
}

function isParticipant(booking) {
  return isAuthenticated() && 
    (request.auth.uid == booking.data.buyerId || 
     request.auth.uid == booking.data.sellerId);
}
```

### Critical Collections Security:

#### Users Collection (Lines 30-36):
- ✅ Read: Any authenticated user
- ✅ Create: Only owner
- ✅ Update: Only owner (protected fields)
- ✅ Delete: Disabled

#### Providers Collection (Lines 39-47):
- ✅ Read: Public profiles
- ✅ Create: Only authenticated users
- ✅ Update: Only owner
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Public profile access needs validation

#### Services Collection:
- Needs review for proper provider ownership
- Price validation implementation
- Category and tag security

### Security Concerns

#### High Priority Issues:
1. **Public Provider Profiles**: Consider data exposure in public reads
2. **Price Validation**: Ensure `isValidPrice()` function protects against manipulation
3. **Booking Participant Logic**: Validate `isParticipant()` covers all edge cases
4. **Message Security**: Need rules for real-time messaging privacy

#### Medium Priority:
1. **Field-level Protection**: Some collections may need granular field access
2. **Admin Operations**: Need separate admin rules for platform management
3. **Audit Logging**: Consider adding access logging for sensitive operations

## Security Rule Testing

### Test Scenarios:
```javascript
// Test authenticated user access
testRules({
  uid: 'user123',
  read: '/users/user123', // Should succeed
  read: '/users/user456', // Should succeed (authenticated)
  write: '/users/user456' // Should fail (not owner)
});

// Test provider access
testRules({
  uid: 'provider123',
  read: '/providers/provider123', // Should succeed
  update: '/providers/provider456' // Should fail (not owner)
});

// Test booking participant access
testRules({
  uid: 'buyer123',
  read: '/bookings/booking456' // Should succeed if participant
});
```

### Production Rule Validation:
- Test with Firebase emulator
- Load test with realistic data volumes
- Validate cross-collection access patterns
- Test rule performance with complex queries
