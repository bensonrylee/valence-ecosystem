## Critical Security Areas

### Stripe Webhook Validation
Current implementation in `lib/stripe-client.ts` includes proper error handling, but webhook validation needs verification:

```typescript
// Ensure webhook signature verification
export async function verifyStripeWebhook(
  payload: string, 
  signature: string
): Promise<Stripe.Event> {
  try {
    return stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
      payload,
      signature,
      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!
    );
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error('Invalid webhook signature');
  }
}
```

### Payment Intent Security
- Validate payment amounts match service prices
- Ensure proper currency handling
- Implement payment confirmation timeouts
- Secure payment method storage

### Marketplace Security
- Connected account verification
- Platform liability protection
- Secure fund transfers
- Commission calculation accuracy

## Webhook Events to Monitor

### Critical Events (Must Handle):
- `checkout.session.completed`
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- `charge.succeeded`
- `charge.refunded`

### Account Events:
- `account.updated`
- `account.application.deauthorized`
- `capability.updated`

### Transfer Events:
- `transfer.created`
